# README
All good projects need a descriptive readme - this one is a summary of a talk given for COG on 2020-03-17

To see the summary and links, open the file `tutorial.md` in the online browser or clone it first.

__If a project doesn't have a readme, nobody is going to want to use it, as it is like having undocumented code, but worse.__

A readme should have instructions on:
1. Basic description of what it does
1. How to install the project
2. Very basic info on how to use it
3. Possibly how to contribute, if applicable
